### Repository:

- **What is repository?**
	- A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
	- Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in the plain text Markdown language


### Create Repository

- **Template:** A repository template is a predefined structure or layout that serves as a starting point for new repositories, streamlining the creation process by providing common files, folders, and configurations.When using a repository template, the following elements are commonly included:	
	1. **Default file and directory structure:** Provides a basic organization for project files.
	2. **Configuration files:** Includes settings for tools, such as CI/CD pipelines or linters.
	3. **README and CONTRIBUTING files:** Offers guidance on how to use and contribute to the project.
	4. **License file:** Specifies the terms under which the project is distributed.
	5. **Code snippets or examples:** Offers reusable code snippets or example files.
	6. **Documentation:** Provides initial documentation to help users understand the project.

- **Repo visibility:** Repository visibility determines who can access and view a repository.
		1. Public  : Accessible to everyone, suitable for open-source projects.
		2. Internal: Visible within the organization, maintaining privacy from external users.
		3: Private : Restricts access to users with explicit permission, ideal for proprietary projects.
  		Note: org admin and enterprise admin can see the repo 


- **Readme file:** A README file is a straightforward document that explains key details about a project.

- **gitignore:** A .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, such as build artifacts or temporary files, to keep the repository clean.

### Pull Requests: ###
 - Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
 - Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
 - Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed.
 - Three types of pull requests:
   
		1. Create a Merge commit :Merging changes from a feature branch into the main branch after PR approval.
		2. Squash and merge	  :Combining all commits from a feature branch into a single commit before merging.
		3. Rebase and merge	  :Rewriting commit history by applying changes onto the tip of the target branch.

### Commits ###

- Like saving a file, a commit is a change to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that tracks:
 
	1. The specific changes
	2. When the changes were made
	3. Who created the changes

### Branch

- Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.You can use branches to:
  
	1. Develop features
	2. Fix bugs
	3. Safely experiment with new ideas

### Tags/Releases

- You can create a release to package software, along with release notes and links to binary files, for other people to use.
- Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

### Gist
- Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets with others.
- Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned.
- Gists can be public or secret.

### GitHub Package
- GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.
- GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations.
- public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server.

### GitHub Action
- GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
- You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created. Your workflow contains one or more jobs which can run in sequential order or in parallel. Each job will run inside its own virtual machine runner, or inside a container, and has one or more steps that either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.
- Key syntax elements used in GitHub Actions:
	- **Name:** The name field is used to provide a descriptive name for the workflow. It helps identify the workflow in the Actions tab on GitHub.
	- **on:** The on field specifies the events that trigger the workflow. You can define events such as push, pull_request, schedule, or a custom event.
	- **jobs:** The jobs field represents the list of jobs that should be executed when the workflow runs. A workflow can have one or more jobs.
	- **runs-on:** The runs-on field specifies the type of runner environment in which the job will be executed. GitHub Actions supports various operating systems and virtual environments.
	- **steps:** The steps field contains a list of actions that are executed in sequence within a job. Each step typically represents a specific task or action to be performed.
	- **name:** The name field provides a descriptive name for each step. It helps identify the step in the workflow log.
	- **uses:** The uses field specifies the action or the composite run steps action that should be executed. It can reference an action from the GitHub Marketplace or a local action defined in your repository.
	- **env:** The env field allows you to define environment variables that can be accessed within the job. These variables can store dynamic values or sensitive information.
	- **run:** The run field contains the shell commands or scripts that are executed as part of the step. You can use multiple lines or a single-line command.
	- **if:** The if field enables conditional execution of a step or job based on an expression. The expression can reference context information such as event data, job status, or environment variables.
	- **with:** The with field allows you to specify additional inputs or parameters for an action or a step. These inputs can be static values or references to context information.
	- **continue-on-error:** The continue-on-error field indicates whether the workflow should continue running or stop if a step fails. By default, the workflow stops on the first step failure.

### GitHub Codespace
- GitHub Codespaces is an instant, cloud-based development environment that uses a container to provide you with common languages, tools, and utilities for development.
- GitHub Codespaces is also configurable, allowing you to create a customized development environment for your project. By configuring a custom development environment for your project, you can have a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

### GitHub Projects
- A project is an adaptable collection of items that you can view as a table, a kanban board, or a roadmap and that stays up-to-date with GitHub data. Your projects can track issues, pull requests, and ideas that you note down.
- You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, and grouping issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your team’s needs and processes.

### GitHub Insights
- It is an analytics tool to give you insights on your software projects and teams. You can collect and analyze all your commits, pull requests, and issues, without sending the data to 3rd party services.

### Markdown in Github
- Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.
	1. **Headings**: Use `#` for headings (e.g., `# Heading 1`).
	   # Heading 1
	
	2. **Bold**: Surround text with `**` (e.g., `**Bold**`).
	   **Bold**
	
	3. **Italic**: Use `*` around text (e.g., `*Italic*`).

	4. **Bold and Italic**: Combine `***` (e.g., `***Bold and Italic***`).
	   ***Bold and Italic***
	
	5. **Unordered List**: Use `-` for list items (e.g., `- Item`).
	   - Item 1
	   - Item 2
	
	6. **Ordered List**: Use numbers (e.g., `1. First item`).
	   1. First item
	   2. Second item
	
	7. **Links**: `[Link text](URL)` to create a link.
	   [Google](https://www.google.com)
	
	8. **Images**: `![Alt text](Image URL)` for images.
	   <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="GitHub Logo" width="150"/>
	
	9. **Inline Code**: Wrap code with backticks (e.g., `` `code` ``).
	   `inline code`
	
	10. **Blockquote**: Start with `>` for quotes (e.g., `> Quote`).
	   > This is a blockquote.
	
	11. **Horizontal Rule**: Use `---` for a line break.
